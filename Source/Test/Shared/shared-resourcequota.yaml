# We use the ResourceQuota object to limit down the total amount of resource used by the namespace.
# Requests are what the containers are guaranteed to get. If the container requests a resource, K8s will only schedule it on a Node that can give it that resource.
# Limits makes sure that a container can never go above a certain value. Containers only allow to go up to the value and are then restricted.
